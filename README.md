# 2D Graphics And Simulation
Part 1: A 2D physics demonstration showcasing collisions between line segments and circles with mass taken into account (Note: I never quite got time to fix up some issues with the mass being taken into effect, may revisit this)

Part 2: "do whatever you want" coursework
  - I was able to choose what my final coursework would be after demonstrating the previous part. Taking the knowledge learned from that and applying it to whatever I want
  - I chose to recreate Pong!
  - (It was originally called Extreme Pong because I had some pretty extreme plans for it that would have truly revolutonised the gaming sphere such as adding a second ball or adding powerups. Due to time limitations, I had to cancel these plans and just make normal Pong)

The 2D graphics in this work is created using HTML canvas. JavaScript was used to create various objects such as physics circles, line segments, bezier curves, etc and was implemented using the scene graph / visitor pattern.
